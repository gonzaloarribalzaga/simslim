# simslim

Run more iOS and tvOS simulators on one Mac by turning off background daemons a simulator does not need.

A freshly booted iOS simulator starts many background services: Siri, Spotlight indexing, media analysis, iCloud sync, and more. simslim can switch those services off for development, testing, and CI, which cuts the measured iOS footprint roughly 4x. tvOS uses the same 170-label category catalog, validated for boot plus TV Settings and Preview Shell on tvOS 26.4; it makes no memory-savings claim yet.

*12 slim simulators on a 16 GB M1 Pro, each driven by its own Claude Code agent through MobAI. Stock simulators start thrashing at around 5.*

## Numbers

One simulator, booted stock and then slimmed, same device and settle time (M1 Pro, 16 GB):

| | Stock | Slim |
|---|---|---|
| Processes | 258 | 70 |
| Memory | 4.0 GB | 0.9 GB |

Memory here is phys_footprint, the figure Activity Monitor shows, which counts compressed and swapped pages. That's what decides how many simulators fit before the machine starts swapping. Run `simslim measure <udid>` to see it for any booted simulator.

`status` and `measure` answer different questions. `status` counts only the
allowlisted launchd labels SimSlim manages; it is not a live-process count. A
slim boot still runs required core services plus system apps and extensions.
`measure` walks every process under that simulator's `launchd_sim` and sums
`phys_footprint`. A sum of `ps` RSS values is not comparable because RSS counts
shared mappings once for every process that maps them.

## Install

```sh
brew install mobai-app/tap/simslim
```

or

```sh
go install github.com/mobai-app/simslim/cmd/simslim@latest
```

macOS only, and you need Xcode with an iOS or tvOS Simulator runtime, since simslim
drives simulators through `xcrun simctl`.

## macOS app

The SwiftUI app bundles the CLI and adds:

- Searchable simulator status, disk-size, and live RAM columns.
- Searchable service profiles with per-daemon controls and purpose summaries.
- Read-only disk analysis plus confirmed cleanup of allowlisted data.
- Clone, rename, erase, delete, and Finder shortcuts.

Build it locally with Go and Xcode:

```sh
make app
open build/SimSlim.app
```

Memory estimates are guidance rather than additive savings; see the
[measurement method](docs/category-memory.md). SimSlim recommends cloning before
service or disk changes so the copy can serve as a backup.

## Usage

```sh
simslim list             # simulators and their slim status (--booted to filter)
simslim profiles         # what a slim boot turns off
simslim profiles --platform tvOS  # the conservative tvOS catalog
simslim profiles <id>    # the launchd labels in one category
simslim on <udid>        # slim a simulator and reboot it slim
simslim on <udid> --no-reboot   # slim the current boot session, no reboot
simslim off <udid>       # put it back to stock
simslim status <udid>    # managed launchd-label state (not a process count)
simslim verify <udid> --profile ci.json   # exact profile match; non-zero on drift
simslim doctor <udid> --requires push,storekit,universal-links
simslim measure <udid>   # a booted simulator's memory footprint
simslim top              # live fleet monitor; enter a sim for per-daemon RAM/CPU
simslim size <udid>      # total allocated simulator size
simslim disk-plan <udid> # measure reclaimable data; read-only
simslim disk-clean --categories caches,logs --confirm <udid>
simslim clone <udid> <name>
simslim repair-clone <source-udid> <clone-udid>
simslim rename <udid> <name>
simslim boot <udid>      # boot a simulator and wait for its services
simslim shutdown <udid>  # shut down a booted simulator
simslim erase <udid>     # erase apps, data, settings, and slimming overrides
simslim delete <udid>    # permanently delete a simulator
```

Read-only and simulator-management commands accept `--json` for integrations
and the macOS app.

Keep a category you actually need, like Spotlight search:

```sh
simslim on <udid> --except search
```

Or keep one specific daemon, like push notifications:

```sh
simslim on <udid> --keep com.apple.apsd
```

### Slow CI runners

`simslim on` boots the simulator, disables ~170 daemons one `launchctl` call at a
time, then reboots — all under a single 10-minute deadline. Shared CI runners (like
GitHub-hosted macOS runners) are slower and less predictable, and can blow that
deadline mid-reconfigure with `context deadline exceeded` errors. Raise it with the
global `--boot-timeout` flag or the `SIMSLIM_BOOT_TIMEOUT` environment variable:

```sh
simslim on <udid> --boot-timeout 15m
# or, for the whole job:
export SIMSLIM_BOOT_TIMEOUT=15m
```

Each individual `launchctl` transition is also bounded by its own 2-minute
timeout, and the first transitions after a cold boot can exceed that on slow
hosts (failed ones are retried automatically). Raise it with the global
`--spawn-timeout` flag or the `SIMSLIM_SPAWN_TIMEOUT` environment variable:

```sh
simslim on <udid> --spawn-timeout 5m
# or, for the whole job:
export SIMSLIM_SPAWN_TIMEOUT=5m
```

### Profile files

For a repeatable setup, commit a JSON profile alongside your project and apply it
per run. A `ci.json` and a `dev.json` can slim differently for each purpose:

```json
{
  "platform": "iOS",
  "name": "ci",
  "description": "UI test runs",
  "except": ["search", "store"],
  "keep": ["com.apple.apsd"]
}
```

```sh
simslim on <udid> --profile ci.json
```

`platform` is optional for legacy files and defaults to `iOS`; use `tvOS` only
with the tvOS catalog. A profile cannot be applied to a simulator of another
platform. `except` and `keep` mirror the flags of the same name; `name` and `description`
are for whoever reads the file. Unknown fields, unknown category IDs, and labels
that no category disables are rejected, so a typo fails loudly. `--profile` is the
single source of truth for its run and cannot be combined with `--except` or
`--keep`.

For the disposable-simulator acceptance procedure behind the initial tvOS 26.4
support, see [tvOS validation](docs/tvos-validation.md).

To build one interactively, run `simslim profile ci.json`: name it, then use the
arrow keys and space to tick whole features to keep enabled, or press `→` to open
a feature and keep individual daemons within it. Point it at a directory to save
`<name>.json` there, or omit the path to print to stdout.

### Checking a simulator with doctor

Slimming a simulator turns features off on purpose, so a test suite that needs
one of them wants a fast way to catch a mis-slimmed simulator before it runs.
`doctor` checks a booted simulator against the features you name and exits
non-zero if any of them are broken, which makes it a natural CI preflight:

```sh
simslim doctor <udid> --requires push,storekit,universal-links
```

```
<udid>: 2/3 required features OK
  ok     push
  ok     universal-links
  BROKEN storekit — com.apple.storekitd disabled
```

Feature IDs are finer-grained than the slimming categories: each maps to just
the daemons that back one capability. Run `simslim doctor --list` to see them
all. Both the check and the list support `--json`.

### Verifying a profile still holds

The disable overrides are per-simulator state that is easy to lose without
noticing: a deleted-and-recreated device or a simulator from a new runtime
comes up stock, and nothing else fails loudly when that happens — the simulator
just quietly runs heavy again. `verify` compares a booted
simulator's overrides against a profile — the same `--profile`/`--except`/`--keep`
you passed to `on` — and exits non-zero listing the drift, so a script or CI
step can catch it and re-run `simslim on` (idempotent: it only applies the
missing delta) to repair:

```sh
simslim verify <udid> --profile ci.json || simslim on <udid> --profile ci.json
```

Where `doctor` answers "do the features my tests need still work?", `verify`
answers "is this simulator in exactly the slim state I configured?". Supports
`--json`.

### Slimming without a reboot

`simslim on --no-reboot` slims the running boot session in place: it disables
each daemon and then boots it out of launchd, so the process stops now and
cannot respawn, with no shutdown/boot cycle. It takes the same
`--profile`/`--except`/`--keep` selection as `on`.

```sh
simslim on <udid> --no-reboot --profile ci.json
```

On iOS and tvOS 18.5 and newer this is simply the faster path; the disable
overrides are stored as well, so the next boot comes up slim too. On older
runtimes, which cannot persist overrides, it is the only way to slim at all,
and the state is gone at the next reboot: re-run it after every boot. `status`
says so when it reads such a simulator, and `status --json` carries a
`persistent` field.

Live slimming only moves toward more-disabled. Managed daemons already disabled
beyond the profile are left alone, because starting a daemon again live would
need a per-label bootstrap; `simslim off` restores them with a reboot.

### Slimming parallel-testing clones

`xcodebuild` parallel testing creates a fresh clone per worker in its own device
set, runs the tests, and deletes the clones when the run ends. The clones are
created stock, and disable overrides do not survive `simctl clone`, so there is
no device to slim ahead of time. `simslim watch` closes that gap: it polls the
device sets and slims each simulator no-reboot the moment it boots, then leaves
it alone until it boots again. A clone slimmed a few seconds into a multi-minute
run keeps its freed memory for the rest of the run. A failed slim is retried on
the next scan, and a device that shut down and booted again is slimmed again,
because below iOS 18.5 a no-reboot slim ends with the boot session.

```sh
simslim watch --except web,store &
xcodebuild test -scheme App -parallel-testing-enabled YES -parallel-testing-worker-count 4 ...
```

It takes the same `--profile`/`--except`/`--keep` selection as `on`, and scans
the default and `testing` sets plus any passed with `--set`. Point `--set` at a
custom parallel-testing device set if your Xcode uses one. It runs until Ctrl-C.

## Disk cleanup

Disk cleanup is permanent and separate from service slimming. `disk-plan` is
read-only. `disk-clean` shuts down the exact simulator, clears only allowlisted
per-device directories, and refuses to run without `--confirm`.

```sh
simslim disk-categories
simslim disk-plan <udid>
simslim disk-clean --categories caches,logs,temporary --confirm <udid>
# Optional: also remove on-demand language models
simslim disk-clean --categories linguistic-data --confirm <udid>
```

Built-in apps and core OS language resources are part of a signed iOS runtime
shared by every simulator using that version, so simslim never modifies them.
Required Siri assets are measured only because iOS restores them on launch;
on-demand language data is opt-in and may download again when needed.

`disk-plan` also reports a read-only storage breakdown for installed app bundles,
Documents, app data, and user media. Those durable rows are never eligible for
cleanup. See the [disk cleanup safety model](docs/disk-cleanup.md) for recovery
behavior, safeguards, and Xcode 26.6 validation results.

## Use as a Go library

The repo root is an importable package with no external dependencies, so you can
drive simulators from your own tooling instead of shelling out to the CLI:

```sh
go get github.com/mobai-app/simslim
```

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/mobai-app/simslim"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	devices, err := simslim.ListDevices(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Slim every booted simulator, keeping Siri and search enabled.
	profile, err := simslim.BuildProfile("", "siri,search", "")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	for _, d := range devices {
		if d.State != "Booted" {
			continue
		}
		changed, err := simslim.EnableSlim(ctx, d.Set, d.UDID, profile, func(msg string) {
			fmt.Println(d.UDID, msg)
		})
		fmt.Println(d.UDID, "changed:", changed, "err:", err)
	}
}
```

The package never writes to stdout — it returns values and reports progress
through the `simslim.Reporter` callback you pass in. `simslim.Categories`,
`simslim.Features`, and `simslim.SlimmableSet()` expose the same allowlist the
CLI uses. macOS only, since everything runs through `xcrun simctl`.

## How it works

`simslim on` writes persistent `launchctl disable` entries for the chosen launchd labels into the simulator's own launchd database, then reboots it. The entries stick across reboots, so the simulator comes up slim in a single boot from then on. `simslim off` clears them and reboots back to stock. Your Mac is never touched, only the simulator you point it at, and only services that are safe to disable. Core workflow services such as `sharingd`, plus the handful that wedge a simulator when turned off, are left running.

Applying a profile normally costs no `launchctl` call at all: the overrides are written straight to the store `launchd_sim` reads when it starts, so the simulator simply boots slim the first time. On an iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 26.5 that turns a 2m14s first slim into 33s, nearly all of it the boot itself. A **booted** simulator takes the same route — an override only takes effect at the next boot, so the shutdown it already owed is spent up front, and slimming one measures 17s end to end. A profile that already matches costs a single read and no reboot at all. The booted simulator is still read back afterwards, and if a runtime ignores the store `simslim` falls back to running `launchctl` per daemon rather than report a slim simulator that isn't one. That fallback runs eight transitions at a time: 2m14s → 38s for 170 labels.

The earliest runtime with verified persistence is iOS 18.5. iOS 17.x and 18.3
accept each `launchctl disable`, but the simulator comes back stock after a
reboot. `simslim on` rejects runtimes older than 18.5 before booting or changing
launchd state and points at `--no-reboot`, which slims the current boot session
only (see [Slimming without a reboot](#slimming-without-a-reboot)). Supported
runtimes are still read back after the reboot, and the command fails instead of
claiming success if any requested override was lost.

This is per-simulator state, not a global setting. The daemon disables live in
that one simulator's launchd database and nowhere else. `simslim clone` copies
the source's exact SimSlim-managed profile along with its installed apps, app
data, and settings. It also rebases simulator-local symlinks, regenerates app
registration databases, and clears copied system caches and temporary files.
Before finishing, it boots the clone and audits its running processes for open
paths into the source. The clone finishes shutdown, and the source returns to
the boot state it had before cloning.

Clones created by an older SimSlim build can be repaired in place without
deleting their installed apps or app data:

```sh
simslim repair-clone <source-udid> <clone-udid>
```

The repair preserves the clone's current SimSlim profile and boot state. The
source is kept shutdown while copied paths are rebuilt; if direct links or open
files into that source remain, the clone stays shutdown instead of being
restarted. CoreSimulator does not expose clone lineage, so pass the exact source
UDID: SimSlim verifies references to the source you specify.

`erase`, `delete` and recreate, and "Erase All Content and Settings" still
produce stock service state, so the simulator's memory climbs back until you
rerun `simslim on`. A simulator created from a new or updated runtime also
starts stock. The slim state persists across simulator shutdowns and reboots on
the same Mac. Moving or restoring a simulator onto another Mac does not preserve
the profile. Run `simslim list` to see current state, or `simslim verify` to
check one against a specific profile.

## What you lose

Turning services off is fine for most development, UI automation, and CI, but some features genuinely stop working. The ones worth knowing:

- Spotlight and in-Settings search return nothing (`search`).
- Push notifications need `apsd`, StoreKit testing needs `storekitd` (`store`).
- Universal links need `swcd` (`web`).
- The Contacts, Photos, and Calendar pickers can act up without their categories.

`simslim profiles` lists every category, so you can keep a category with `--except` or individual daemons with `--keep`.

## Why

Testing is shifting. Once agents are writing apps, you want agents running them too, and the place an iOS app runs is a simulator. One agent, one simulator. So how much work you get through at once comes down to how many simulators a machine can hold, and stock simulators are heavy enough that a laptop fills up fast. Slimming them is the cheapest way to raise that ceiling: more simulators on the box means more agents working in parallel on it.
